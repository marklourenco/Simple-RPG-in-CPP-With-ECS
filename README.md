### Made by [Mark Lourenco](https://github.com/marklourenco), [Morgan Chin Tang](https://github.com/MorganChinTang) and [Narda Limon](https://github.com/Narda05)

#### Overview
This is a text-based-game we made for school while studying the Entity-Component-System (ECS) and C++ language. The goal is to create a fully functional game engine and apply it on a simple game to show it's capabilities. 
We had two weeks to complete this project in June. Our goal is to utilize the ECS and make a fully functional game that lets players complete quests to fight monsters. 

#### Features
Players have a health system, and they can also possess skills to attack or heal. 
Player also have an chance to obtain a weapon that increases their attack damage. 

The enemies will have a random damage dealt to player every turn. 

And each quest will be assignming player to kill x ammount of certain enemy. 
For example, 

Quest:

Kill 3 Drakes 1/3

in this case, the player has killed 1 Drake and has 2 more kills yet to complete.
